I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Technology at York University. I earned my Ph.D in Computing Science from Simon Fraser University (2021.01 - 2024.08) under the supervision of Prof. [Jian Pei](https://ece.duke.edu/people/jian-pei/). My research lies at the intersection of data science and machine learning, with a particular focus on data valuation in data markets and machine learning. 
<!-- My work has been published in top-tier data management venues, including SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, and KDD. 
Beyond my research, I am actively engaged in the academic community, serving as a program committee member for ICDE 2025 and as the local chair for KDD 2025. I also bring extensive industry experience from my time at leading companies such as Amazon. -->

**Research Areas**:  Data Science, Data Valuation, Data Market, Machine Learning

# Prospective Students

I am recruiting multiple Ph.D. students with strong backgrounds in data science, databases, data engineering, or machine learning. I am particularly interested in students passionate about:
- Data markets and their applications
- Data valuation in machine learning
- Interpretation of data valuation methods

Interested applicants should email me their CV, transcripts, and a brief self-introduction with **[Prospective Ph.D. Student]** in the subject line. Women and individuals from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply.

<!-- Due to large amount of emails, I may not be able to respond to all inquiries. -->

If you are a York University undergraduate, M.S., or admitted Ph.D. student interested in working with me, feel free to email or visit my office for a chat.

<!-- reeived my Phd degree (supervisor: Prof. [Jian Pei](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/jian-pei)). I received my Bachelor's degree from Tongji University and my Master's degree from the University of British Columbia (supervisor: Prof. [Victor C.M. Leung](https://ece.ubc.ca/victor-leung/)).  -->
<!-- I am expected to graduate in Summer 2024. -->
